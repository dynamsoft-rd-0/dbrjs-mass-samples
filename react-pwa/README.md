# Hello World Sample for React with Hooks

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a JavaScript library meant explicitly for creating interactive UIs. Follow this guide to learn how to implement [Dynamsoft Barcode Reader JavaScript SDK](https://www.dynamsoft.com/barcode-reader/sdk-javascript/) (hereafter called "the library") into a React application. Note that in this sample we will use `TypeScript` and [Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html). Also, there is another sample `react` defining components as classes in React.

In this guide, we will be using [`dynamsoft-barcode-reader-bundle 10.4.3100](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dynamsoft-barcode-reader-bundle/v/10.4.3100).

> Note:

> If youâ€™re looking to integrate DBR-JS into a framework that we don't yet have a sample, don't worry! We have a [comprehensive guide](https://www.dynamsoft.com/barcode-reader/docs/web/programming/javascript/user-guide/use-in-framework.html) that provides detailed instruction and best practices for a seamless  integration into any frameworks!
